              <div class="about-content">
                <p>Hey, I’m Dayna, a tenacious Kiwi with an insatiable curiosity and a knack for problem-solving. In New Zealand, we call it the <strong>Number 8 wire</strong> mentality - finding creative solutions with whatever’s on hand. Raised by an extraordinary single mother, I learned early on that resilience, kindness, and hard work pave the way for a life well-lived. She taught me that I was enough, encouraged me to chase what sets my soul on fire, and showed me the power of lifting others up along the way.</p>

                <p>At my core, I’m a glass-half-full kind of person. Upbeat, driven, and always looking for ways to grow. Self-awareness isn’t just something I value; it’s how I move through the world. Whether it’s offering my seat on the Tube, returning my glass to the bar, or giving a stranger a genuine compliment just to brighten their day - I believe that small acts of kindness can make a big difference. To me, being a good human is about showing up, doing my part, and leaving every space (and person) a little better than I found them.</p>
                
                <p>Challenge? Bring it on. I thrive on pushing boundaries, solving problems, and saying "yes" to opportunities - even the slightly terrifying ones. Growth and learning are always at the heart of what I do, and I’m constantly seeking new ways to expand my skills, perspectives, and experiences.</p>
                
                <p>Engineering and problem-solving have been in my DNA since childhood. If there was an appliance in our house, you’d find me taking it apart just to see how it worked <em>(sorry about the CD player I couldn’t get back together, Mum)</em>. My mind is constantly asking, <em>“Is there a better way to do this?”</em> That relentless curiosity still drives me today, whether it’s optimising systems, fine-tuning processes, or helping a team bring their vision to life.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond work, you’ll find me fully embracing life’s adventures learning to drum up a storm, saving goals for Tooting Bec Reserves, snowboarding down a mountain, or simply showing up for people who need a hand. At the end of the day, it’s all about connection, impact, and making the most of every moment.</p>
